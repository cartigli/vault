linear regression is the simplex non-trivial relationship
		called so because of the equation

one can double check or test if it is a linear equation by plotting the variables x and y against each other on a scatter plot
			only two dimensions are in play; the relationship and mapping of regression is basic

If the data flowed in a direction other than straight, linearity would be violated & linear regression would be inappropriate
