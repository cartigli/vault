assumptions before any regression model analysis

[[V Stats in Python/II Multi-Var Linear Regression/Five Assumptions/I Linearity]]
			linear regression, linear in nature, simplest regression, variables are multiplied by coefficients 

[ No Endogeneity ]
		covariance of the error; $\sigma_{x\epsilon}$ = 0 : 

[ Normality and Homoscedasticity ]
		normality is when the error term is normally distributed
		homoscedasticity is basically constant variance throughout
				{{ $\epsilon \sim N (0, \sigma^2)$ }}

[ No Autocorrelation ]
		naturally, the covariance of any two error terms is 0

[ No Multicollinearity ]
		when two or more variables have a high correlation together

**no regression analysis' can be done if any of these five assumptions is violated**
