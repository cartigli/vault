$\hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 . . . + \beta_k x_k$
$prediction = y - intercept + independent - variables$ {{ $x_1 - x_k$ }}

when we add more than 2 variables, the graphical representations disappear because the dimensions rise over 3; imperceivable to us

as SSE increases, the SSR increases; as we add more variables, we theoretically add more explanatory power to our model

to fit multi-variate equations or models, $R^2$ becomes $R^2 Adjusted$
	$R^2 Adjusted$ is always smaller than $R^2$ because it penalizes the use of excess characters
