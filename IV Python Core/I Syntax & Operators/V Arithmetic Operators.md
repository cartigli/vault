1 + 3 {outputs 4}
2 - 1 {outputs 1}

In this, 1, 3, 2, & 1 are [Operands] and +, - are [Arithmetic Operators] ^operandsEx

[Division] \
15 / 3 {outputs 5}
	16 // 3 {also outputs 5, as the quotient is an integer [[III Integers, Floats, and Boolean]]}
		16 / 3 {outputs 5.333...}
		16 //3 {outputs 5; discards remainder}
	% {obtain the remainder of the division}
		16 % 3 {outputs 1; the remained of 16/3}

[Multiplication] *
	3 * 5 {returns 15}
		also, could run x = 5 * 3, then, x returns 15

[Exponents] ** [[II Built-In Functions#^c0cd44]]
	3 ** 2 {3 to the power of 2; or $3^2$}
