Uploaded ' patients.csv ' to chat gtp ; ask it to preprocess our data

it shows some holes, and outlines data

we ask it to devise a plan and check what is suggested
	ask it to encode the categorical data

we have. avlaue 'unkown'
	can we implememnt a ML algorythm to resolve it?
	chat gpt decides decision trees could resolve it
		it tried, and got 6% accuracy [bad]
	have it try the alternative method ; knn
		got 30% accuracy

if we can't or dont want to upload sensitive data to chat ex:
	ratings.csv, prducts.csv, orders.csv, customers.csv
	customers.csv:
		holds just customer id's
	product.csv:
		product id, product type, price
	order.csv:
		order, customer, product id, and quantity + time of purchase
	ratings.csv:
		prduct ratings with customer and rating id's and ratings values

we want top products, and top clients, maybe revenue 
	we'll use chat to get us to use python to perform the analysis ourselves
	prompt:"
Hello gemini, 
I have the following data sets and columns:
	customers = customer_id, name
	products = product_id, product_name, price, category
	ratings = customer_id, product_id, rating
	orders = order_id, customer_id, product_id, order_date, quantity
		I wish to analyze the data and find out the top performing products in terms of revenue, as well as in terms of how many units have been sold, and identify the top clients for the last month. Can you provide me with the python code to achieve this?"
	- i had to convince it not to generate replacement data because I did not supply it the contents, and it seemed weary of this, but gave the python below
	- compared to the video, gemini kinda over did this one

**SPOILER** the script output this:
