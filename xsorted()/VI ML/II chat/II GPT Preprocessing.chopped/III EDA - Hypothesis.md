looking for general patterns in the data, heatmaps, scatter plots, etc.,

GUESS FUCKING WHAT we asked chat to do it for us, whooped di fucking doo

another dataset contains student grades, id's, and whether or not they attended remedial classes
we'd like to find out if remedial classes improved the grades at all

$H_0$ = no significant difference between grades of students in remedial classes and those who are not
$H_1$ = there is a substantial discrepancy between the two

	we need a two sided test
	1. give data to chat ; please read and describe this file to me
		1. it shits out a response
	2. respond: Is there a statistically significant difference in the performance between students who attended remedial classes and those who did not?
		1. claude can't read csv's, apparently
		2. anyway, it generated the following code for us:
		3. tbh it killed itExcellent question! I chose a t-test over a z-test for several important statistical reasons:

## **Key Reasons for Using a t-test:**

**1. Unknown Population Standard Deviation**

- We only have sample data from your CSV file
- We don't know the true population standard deviation (σ) for student grades
- We can only estimate it from our sample standard deviation (s)
- When σ is unknown, the t-distribution accounts for this additional uncertainty

**2. Sample Size Considerations**

- Your dataset has 100 students total, split between two groups
- Even if each group had 50 students, this isn't large enough to reliably use the Central Limit Theorem approximation
- The "rule of thumb" is typically n ≥ 30 per group for z-tests, but t-tests are more appropriate for smaller samples

**3. Statistical Theory**

- When using sample standard deviation instead of population standard deviation, the sampling distribution follows a t-distribution, not a normal distribution
- The t-distribution has heavier tails than the normal distribution, accounting for the additional uncertainty from estimating σ

## **When Would You Use a Z-test?**

A z-test would be appropriate if:

- You knew the true population standard deviation (σ)
- OR you had very large sample sizes (typically n > 100 per group)
- OR you were testing a single proportion rather than means

## **Practical Impact**

For your sample sizes, the difference between t-critical values and z-critical values is small but meaningful:

- Z-critical (α = 0.05, two-tailed): ±1.96
- T-critical (α = 0.05, two-tailed, df ≈ 98): ±1.984

The t-test provides a more conservative and statistically correct approach for your data situation.

3. why did you choose a t-test over a z-score?

Excellent question! I chose a t-test over a z-test for several important statistical reasons:
Key Reasons for Using a t-test:

A z-test would be appropriate if:

OR you had very large sample sizes (typically n > 100 per group)
OR you were testing a single proportion rather than means

For your sample sizes, the difference between t-critical values and z-critical values is small but meaningful:

Z-critical (α = 0.05, two-tailed): ±1.96
T-critical (α = 0.05, two-tailed, df ≈ 98): ±1.984
