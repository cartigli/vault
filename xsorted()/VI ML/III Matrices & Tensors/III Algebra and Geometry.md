[scalars] have no dimensions; they are shit for brains locations, don't show direction, angle, speed, nuthin'
	[points] have the same characteristics, through and through
$$\begin{bmatrix}
	222
	\end{bmatrix} = \bullet$$

*make a wild guess what's next*

[vectors] have one more dimension than a scalar, they show direction
	[lines] have the same characteristics! See a pattern?
		lines are single dimensional; whichever direction they point
			fundamentally, a line is a collection of points
			==
			a vector is a collection of scalars!

*but wait, to plot or graph a line, we need something we're missing*
**the second dimension**

to plot a line, we need a space, and to get a space (more so than a line is a space) we need to cross two lines
	*what happens when we use two single dimensioned objects together?*
		we gain a dimension :)

[Matrices] are a multidimensional; they have any dimensions<1
	to get 2 dimensional space, we combined two lines, soo...
		to get the same for Matrices, we'll combine two vectors!
			this gives us a platform for representing any two dimensional space
				as you increase dimensions {{ like adding vectors, but imagine directions cannot repeat and you start in a perfect vacuum devoid of direction }} by adding lines, first to show 1 dimension with one vector, the second vector illustrates the second dimension, the third vector would illustrate the third dimension . . . each time you added a vector to that vaccuum devoid of direction, you added essentially a row or column to the matrix describing your space dimensionally

Another way to think of these relationships would be a line { 1D } is enough to illustrate a dot's location on said line; and in the  same way, a {2D } area or plane is enough to illustrate a line's location on said plane
	do not overthink this, but ^ this is *the exact same freaking relationship* that [scalars], [vectors], and [matrices] have
		A [scalar]'s relative position could be easily shown with a [vector] which included the surrounding [scalar]s, and a [vector]'s relative position could be shown with a [matrix] of the surrounding [vector]s, 
			each show one more dimension than the object they try to illustrate information for
