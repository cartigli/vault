Scalars: matrices containing one row and one column, or one element
	$$\begin{bmatrix}
	777
	\end{bmatrix}$$
essentially every number you see, $\pi, \infty, \epsilon$ are all scalars

Vectors: singe dimension objects, practically the simplest algebraic object
	$$\begin{bmatrix}
	2 \\
	5 \\
	0
	\end{bmatrix}$$
	*usually, matrices are considered and analyzed as if they are a collection of vectors, i.e., one for each column or row*
		logically, here comes the shit
		two types of vectors:
				$$\text{Column Vector} =\begin{bmatrix}
	9 \\
	1 \\
	7
	\end{bmatrix}$$
				$$\text{Row Vector}=\begin{bmatrix}
		5 & 4 & 9 & 0 
		\end{bmatrix}$$
intuitive af
we often want to know how many elements are in a vector
	a.k.a. : the length of the vector
		$\text{Column Vector}$ has a length of 3
		$\text{Row Vector}$ has a length of 4
			further notated as: 
				length = m, where m is the number of elements in a vector
					in the $\text{Column Vector}$ , $9 = x_1, 1=x_2, 7=x_3$ & $7=x_m$ due to this vector's length, m
				as vectors are single dimensional, any vector's shape is 1 x m
