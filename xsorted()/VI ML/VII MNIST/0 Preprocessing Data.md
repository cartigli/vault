Compatibility, orders of magnitude, Generalization

Often, we want relative values instead of value.

Log transformations are done to relative data to better show patterns among complex datasets.

Standardization : Feature Scaling
Transform the data your using is standardized with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1
	Subtract every data point or feature from the mean of the data set and divide by the standard deviation
		$=\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}


There's also PCA and 

Principal Components Analysis is a dimension reduction technique  ; groups variables of similar meaning into one dimension
Whitening is often done after PCA and removes underlying correlations between the data points, when these correlations are seen in the outputs.
