Interacting with and opening files with Python.

open( ) is a built-in function
```python
open(file_path, access_mode)
```
Access modes: 
	   r = read only
		 w = opens a file to write only, makes a file if doesn't exist

Ok, this is much simpler than I expected

```python
with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
	line_count = 0
	for line in file:
		line_count += 1
	return line_count
```


```python
import os  
  
# Get the current working directory  
current_directory = os.getcwd()  
print(f"Current working directory: {current_directory}")  
  
# List contents of a directory  
contents = os.listdir(current_directory)  
print(f"Contents of current directory: {contents}")

os.walk()
```

```python
import os

for root, dirs, files in os.walk('/Volumes/HomeXx/compuir/vault/xsorted()/III SQL'):
	print(f"{root}, {dirs}, {files}")
```


Count file lengths recursively through a given folder:
```python
import os

file_path = '/Volumes/HomeXx/compuir/vault'

line_cnt_list = []

for root, dirs, files in os.walk(file_path):
	for filename in files:
		full_file_path = os.path.join(root, filename)
		try:
			with open(full_file_path, 'r') as file:
				line_count = 0
				for line in file:
					line_count += 1
				line_cnt_list.append(line_count)
		except:
			continue

line_cnt_list.sort()

print(max(line_cnt_list))
print(line_cnt_list)
```

```python
import os

file_path = '/Volumes/HomeXx/compuir/vault'

char_cnt_list = []

for root, dirs, files in os.walk(file_path):
	for filename in files:
		full_file_path = os.path.join(root, filename)
		try:
			with open(full_file_path, 'r') as file:
				char_count = 0
				for line in file:
					char_count += len(line)
				char_cnt_list.append(char_count)
		except:
			continue

char_cnt_list.sort()

print(max(char_cnt_list))
print(char_cnt_list)
```



Count characters recursively through a given folder:
```python
import os

file_path = '/Volumes/HomeXx/compuir/vault/xVault'

char_cnt_list = []

for root, dirs, files in os.walk(file_path):
	for filename in files:
		full_file_path = os.path.join(root, filename)
		try:
			with open(full_file_path, 'r') as file:
				char_count = 0
				for line in file:
					char_count += len(line)
				char_cnt_list.append((char_count, filename))
		except:
			continue

char_cnt_list.sort()

print(max(char_cnt_list))
print(char_cnt_list)
```

Let's make a list of files then commands for MySQL instead of trying to connect the API or manually inserting text.
This one outputs a list of of the files' location within the given dir:
```python
import os

file_path = '/Volumes/HomeXx/compuir/vault'

files_dedir = []

for root, dirs, files in os.walk(file_path):
	for filename in files:
		full_file_path = os.path.join(root, filename)
		try:
			files_dedir.append(full_file_path)
		except:
			continue

print(len(files_dedir))
print(files_dedir)
```
*Let's try to make the files be output on a different line for every file on a new line:*
```python
import os

file_path = '/Volumes/HomeXx/compuir/vault'
files_dedir = []

for root, dirs, files in os.walk(file_path):
	for filename in files:
		full_file_path = os.path.join(root, filename)
		try:
			print(full_file_path)
		except:
			continue
```
*Ok, close enough, we can make a .py file with these contents and run ' file.py > file_lo.txt ' and the full path for every file in the given directory is printed.*
```python
import os

file_path = ./scpt.txt

for line in file_path,
	print(line)
```


Alright, so the script below prints all the lines of the file one at a time. Much closer.
```python
import os  

file_path = '/Volumes/HomeXx/intel/scpt.txt'

with open(file_path, 'r')as f:
	for line in f:
		print(line, end=' ')
```
*Additionally, with an Auto_Incrementing Primary Key, we don't need a generated number for the iteration when creating the collection of insertion queries.*


Sike, I'm doing too much. That first one is fine, the hell was I thinking?
```python
import os

file_path = '/Volumes/HomeXx/compuir/vault'
files_dedir = []

for root, dirs, files in os.walk(file_path):
	for filename in files:
		full_file_path = os.path.join(root, filename)
		try:
			print(f"INSERT INTO n1 (title, notes)\nVALUES ('{filename}', LOAD_FILE('{full_file_path}));")
		except:
			continue
```
*Have this output go to a .sql file and then load it into my workbench for execution.*
