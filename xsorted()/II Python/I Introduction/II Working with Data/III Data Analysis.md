where do we find Big Data? Everywhere. In every type, format, and variety.
Facebook 
- collects all user IDs, voice-bytes, and more
Financial Trading Data
- collections of stock values every second over x = time period

Data Analysis + Business Intuition [applied] = Business Intelligence

ex: 
- How did our email marketing perform last quarter *in terms of* click-through rates and revenue generated? 
- How does it compare to the same quarter *last year*?

How do we measure business performance?

[Observation]
- collect observations
	- new enrollment, increase in monthly revenue 

[Quantifications]
- process of quantification of observations as numbers; numerical values

[Measures]
- accumulation of [quantified] observations to show some information, relationship, trend
- simple descriptive statstic
	- ex: $350 revenue in 1st quarter; 50 new customers in 1st quarter

[Metric]
- derived from measures
- equates to metric = measure + business meaning
- given context, essentially
	- $350/50 customers = $7 revenue / customer [in 1st quarter]
	- $7 revenue per customer is a metric 

Key Performance Indicators [KPI] 
- metrics [indicators of business performance] + business objectives
	- metric = traffic on webpage from all users
	- KPI = traffic solely generated from link provided by new email campaign
		- metric = measurement
		- KPI = specific metric correlating with specific objective
			- BI dashbaords should only be built with KPI's
			- dashboard of metrics would be wasteful, inefficient, *unintelligent*
