data = raw facts, processed data, information, and more

raw data -> processing -> information [meaningful]

primary [raw] data = can't be analyzed right away
- gathered through data collection
- surveys, cookies, 
after [raw] collection, data enters 'pre-processing'
preprocessing repairs holes in collected [raw] data
	- i.e., someone's age: 192, Name: United Kingdom
	- both are false, and should be removed, or excluded from alaysis

[Techniques for managing Traditional Data]

[Sorting]
- class labeling
	- ex: numerical values
	- units, amounts
- categorical
		- cannot be manipulated

[Data Cleansing]
- incorrect, mis-entered values, missing inputs
- ex: someone fills occupation & salary, but not state
	- do you average all ages? remove entire entry?
	- must be solved before further processing can take place

[Balancing]
- take survey response, and get 80% female; 20% male
- could take equal amount from each group, making sources same size

[Shuffling]
	- randomly reorders data collected
	- improves predictive performance 
	- avoids misguided results [improper collection issues]

[Visual]
RDMS
- relational database management systems
- entity-relationship [er] diagram
- shapes convey relationships between databases

Relational Schema [RS]
	- connects related tables, and unrelated
