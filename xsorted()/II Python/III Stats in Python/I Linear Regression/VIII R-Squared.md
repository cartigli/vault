Total Variability = Explained + Unexplained {{ SST } = { SSR } + { SSE }}
$R^2 = SSR / SST$
	ranges from 0 to 1; 0 means the regression explains NONE of the variability, while 1 means the regression explains ALL of the variability
		requirements vary; science looks for 0.7-.99; psych or socio could find $r^2$ of .2 valuable, however

					*in this example, we scored an $R^2$ of 0.406, which translates to something akin to SAT scores explained 41% of the variability in GPA for our sample
						 $R^2$ of 0.406 is neither good nor bad; only suggests there are probably more factors and other variables than SAT scores explaining GPA's
