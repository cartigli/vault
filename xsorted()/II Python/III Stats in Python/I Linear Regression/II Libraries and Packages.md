Python libraries for Stats modeling:
	NumPy - work with multi-dimensional arrays
	Pandas - allows organization of data in tabular form and to attach descriptive labels to rows and columns
	SciPy - suitable for mathematics, engineering, heavy computation
	StatsModels - built on NumPy and SciPy
	Matplotlib - 2d plotting library specially designed for visualization of NumPy computations
	Seaborn - visualization; based on Matplotlib
	scikit-learn - widely used machine learning library
