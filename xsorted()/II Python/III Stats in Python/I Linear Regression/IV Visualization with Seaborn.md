```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import statsmodels.api as sm # same libraries as before
import seaborn as sns # more attractive than matplotlib alone
sns.set() # overrides styling and graphics for all matplotlib's graphs
# in initial ex, sns added background and smoother feel
# akin to a skin for matplotlib
