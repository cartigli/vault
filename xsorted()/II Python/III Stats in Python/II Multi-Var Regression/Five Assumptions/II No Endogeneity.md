No Endogeneity for Regressors
		a prohibited link between independent variables and errors
					expressed as:
						the covariance of the error and the independent variables should be 0 for all independent variables and error terms, or:
						$\sigma_{X\epsilon} = 0 : \forall x, \epsilon$
						
error, or difference between the observed value and expected, is correlated with our independent values
			this is a problem, called [Omitted Variable Bias], which occurs when you forget a relevant variable
				y is explained by x
				y is also explained by x*
						=> most likely, x and x* are somewhat correlated, but if omitted, it has nothing to correlate with, so it correlated with the error

start to analyze if occurs and variables are overwhelming; can I get a better sample? What could be off about the current sample? What are crucial factors of the dependent variable, y, what could be missing?
