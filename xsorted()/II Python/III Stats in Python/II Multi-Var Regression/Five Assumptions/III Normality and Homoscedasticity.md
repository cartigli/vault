$\epsilon \sim N ( 0 , \sigma^2 )$

[ Normality ]
		we assume $\epsilon$ {{ error }} is normally distributed

[ Zero mean ]
			$...N( 0,...$ means the sample is normally distributed over the mean: 0

[ Homoscedasticity ]
			the error is equally distributed
			an example of this not happening is a demerging dataset; its variance increases as x and y increase; impossible to statistically analyze and suggests a different kind of problem
					prevention:
							check for Omitted Variable Bias
							remove outliers
							log transformation
				Log Transformation:
							take the natural log of the variable
							take a regression between the log of the independent y and the independents x
