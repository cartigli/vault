```python
prices = {
    "box_of_spaghetti" : 4,
    "lasagna"  : 5,
    "hamburger" : 2
   }
quantity = {
    "box_of_spaghetti" : 6,
    "lasagna"  : 10,
    "hamburger" : 0
    }

money_spent = 0

for i in prices:
	#money_spent = 0 # this doesn't work because its inside the loop; below is a revised loop with repaired functionality with money_spent = 0 inside the fx
    if prices[i] >= 5:
        money_spent = money_spent + (prices[i] * quantity[i])

print(money_spent)
```
REVISED:
```python
prices = {
    "box_of_spaghetti" : 15,
    "lasagna"  : 4.99,
    "hamburger" : 67
   }
quantity = {
    "box_of_spaghetti" : 37,
    "lasagna"  : 298,
    "hamburger" : 14
    }

def count_money(prices, quantity):
	money_spent=0
	for i in prices:
		if prices[i] >= 5:
			money_spent=money_spent+(prices[i]*quantity[i])
	print(money_spent)

count_money(prices, quantity)
```
IMPROVED:
```python
prices = {
    "box_of_spaghetti" : 15,
    "lasagna"  : 4.99,
    "hamburger" : 67
   }
quantity = {
    "box_of_spaghetti" : 37,
    "lasagna"  : 298,
    "hamburger" : 14
    }

def count_money(prices, quantity):
	money_spent=0
	for i in prices:
		if prices[i] >= 5:
			money_spent=money_spent+(prices[i]*quantity[i])
	return money_spent

total = count_money(prices, quantity)
print('All your super-spendings:',{total})

#total = money_spent
#print('Total money spent at the supermarket:','{total}')
```
