Collection of probabilities for each possible outcome

Independent events
Rolling a 6-sided dye

E(A) = two rolls; 6 options each
- roll a 3 on first, a 5 on second roll
- regardless of first roll, 6 possible outcomes for second roll
- 36 possible rolls for the two probabilities

^^ Outcomes possible for the two dye rolls; 36 possible sums of the two dye
7 Occurs 6 times on the table / out of 36 possibilities: P(7) = 6 / 36 = 1 / 6

6, 7, & 8 have the highest probabilities
7 is the Peak
