Lock with two dials, each one has a, b, & c options
- choose a for 1st
	- 3 optins left
	- 3 options for 1st
- 3 more = 3 * 3 options = 9 variations

$\bar{v} = n^p$
- n = total elements available
- p = number of positions to fill
	- $\bar{v} \frac{3}{2}, n = 3, p = 2$
	- $\bar{v} = 3^2$
	- $\bar{v} = 9 \text{combinations}$
	What if lock could use any letters?
		$n = 26$
		$\bar{v} = 26^2$
		$\bar{v} = 676 \text{ combinations}$
