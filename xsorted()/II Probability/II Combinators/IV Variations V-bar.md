Lock with two dials, each one has a, b, & c options
- choose a for 1st
	- 3 optins left
	- 3 options for 1st
- 3 more = 3 x 3 options = 9 variations

v{bar} = n^p
- n = total elements available
- p = number of positions to fill
	- V {bar} 3/2, n = 3, p = 2
	- V{bar} = 3^2
	- V{bar} = 9 combinations
	What if lock could use any letters?
		n = ~~3~~ 26
		V{bar} = 26^2
		V{bar} = 676 combinations
