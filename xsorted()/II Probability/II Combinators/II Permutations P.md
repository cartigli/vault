3 drivers of podium; x, y, & z
P(3) = all different combinations of drivers in order
If X wins, two combos of y or z's order
If Y wins, two combos of x or z's order
If Z wins, two combos of x or y's order

Calculating possibilities for n = elements
n possible outcomes
n-1 possible outcomes in 2nd 
n-2 possible outcomes for 3rd

P(n) = n x ( n - 1 ) x ( n - 2 ) x . . . = n! [n factorial]
