We can pick p-many elements in as many ways as we can pick n minus p-many elements

y_axis| _ x x x x x x _ x_axis

$y = C^n_p$ 
$x = 0 - n$
$C^n_p$ has symmetry over $\frac{n}{2}$
Combinations are maxed when $\frac{n}{2} = p$

Ex: 3 [p] of 10 [n] employees for conference 
$C^{10}_3 = 120$
if 7, $C^{10}_7 = 120$
So; picking 7 combinations of people to go to the conference is the same as picking 3 combinations to stay/go
They are symmetrical across the example graph above

Maximum Combinations $\frac{n}{2}: C^{10}_5 = \frac{10!}{(10 - 5)! 5!}$
	$C^{10}_5 = \frac{10!}{(5!) 5!}$
	$C^{10}_5 = \frac{6 \cdot 7 \cdot 8 \cdot 9 \cdot 10}{5!}$
	$C^{10}_5 = \frac{6 \cdot 7 \cdot 8 \cdot 9 \cdot 10}{1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5}$
	$C^{10}_5 = \frac{6 \cdot 7 \cdot 8 \cdot 9 \cdot 10}{5!}$
	$C^{10}_5 = \frac{30240}{120}$
	$C^{10}_5 = 252$
