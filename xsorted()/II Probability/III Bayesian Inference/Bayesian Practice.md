B2 Diversity at Hamilton College
Use Bayes Law to see if student body to determine if the freshmen class is the average for that specific nationality

A = First Years
B = Black

P(A) = 480 / 1897
P(A) = 0.253
	25.3% of students are freshmen

Probability of a student being black
P(B) = 80 / 1897
P(B) = 0.042
	4.2 % of students are black

Probability of a freshmen being black
P(A $\cap$ B) = 26 / 1897
P(A $\cap$ B) = 0.014
	1.4% of freshmen are black

Probability of a black student being a freshmen
P(A|B) = 26 / 80
P(A|B) = 0.325
	32.5% chance a black student is a freshmen
		not .25, so increase in diversity in freshmen year

Additive rule:
A $\cup$ B = 480 + 80 -26
A $\cup$ B = 534
P(A $\cup$ B) = 534 / 1897
P(A $\cup$ B) = 0.281
	28% of student body is a freshman, or identifies as black

A = Freshmen
B = Black
C = Hispanic
P(A|B) = P(A $\cap$ B) / P(B)
	Probability of being a black, given you are a freshmen, is equal to the probability of being black a black freshmen over the probability of being black
P(A|B) = 26 / 480
P(A|B) = 0.054
	5.4% chance a freshmen student identifies as black

P(C|A) = Probability of being a Hispanic, given they are a freshmen
P(A) = Probability of being a freshmen
P(A $\cap$ C) = P(A) P(C|A)
	P(C|A) = 57 / 480
	P(C|A) = 0.1187
	P(A) = .253
		P(A $\cap$ C) = .263 * .119
		P(A $\cap$ C) = 0.03
		probability of being a latino freshmen is 3%

Now, probability of a latino being a freshmen
	Bayes' Law: Probability of being a freshmen, given you are a latino, is equal to the probability of being a latino, given you are a freshnmen, times the probability of being a freshmen divided by the probability of being a latino
	P(A|C) = P(C|A) P(A) / P(C)
		P(C) = 167 / 1897
		P(C) = 0.088
		P(A) = .253
		P(C|A) = 0.119
		P(A|C) = 0.119 x .253 / 0.088
		P(A|C) = .338
			the probability of a student being in their first year, given they are hispanic, is 33.8%
