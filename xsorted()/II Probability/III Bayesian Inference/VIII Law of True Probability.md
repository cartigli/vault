survey: 100 men & women asked if they meat

|       | NoM | Meat | tot |
| ----- | --- | ---- | --- |
| women | 15  | 32   | 47  |
| men   | 29  | 24   | 53  |
| tot   | 44  | 56   | 100 |
15/47 men are vegan
29/53 men are vegan
Event A = being vegitarian
Event B = being a women
Event C - being a man
	P(A|B) = 14/47; likelihood of a women being a vegan
	P(B|A) = 15/44; likelihood of a vegan being a women

A = B1 $\cup$ B2 $\cup$ B3 $\cup$ ... Bn
A = P(A|B1) x P(B1) + P(A|B2) x P(B2) + P(A|B3) x P(B3) ... P(A|Bn) x P(Bn)
	Probability of being vegan is the P(A|B) x P(B) + P(A|C) x P(C) = 
	P(Being Vegan) = 29/53 x 53/100 + 14/47 x 47/100
	P(Being Vegan) = 0.44
