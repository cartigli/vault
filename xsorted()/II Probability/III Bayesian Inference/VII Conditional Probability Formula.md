Likelihood of an event occuring, given another one has already occured
A = heads
B = tails
	if P(A) = P(A|B), Events A & B are independent

A = Queen of Spades
B = Spades
C = Queen
	P(A) = 1/52
	P(A|B) = 1/13
	P(A|C) = 1/4
		can say event A depends on B & C

P(A|B) = P(A$\cap$B) / P(B)
	as long as P(B) > 0

P(A|B) = P(A$\cap$B) / P(B) is similar to P(x) = favourable / all
The new favorable is the intersection of A $\cap$ B so they both must occur to satisfy the conditinonal;
	P(B) has to happen, so for this case, P(B) = all
		P(A|B) $\neq$ P(B|A)

What is the probability of event A occuring, given event B has occured if the liklihood of getting the intersection of their events is 0.15 and P(B) is 0.6?
	P(A|B) = 0.15 / 0.6
	P(A|B) = .25
