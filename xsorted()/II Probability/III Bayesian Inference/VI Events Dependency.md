Flipping a coin - 50% regardless of previous event

dependent events - probabilities vary as conditions change
	drawing cards - p(drawing a spade)
	pull 5 spades; p(drawing a spade) decreases with every pull

Events (A) & Events (B)
	the probability of getting (A), if we are given that (B) has occurred 
	$P(A|B) = P(A) \text{ given} P(B)$
	Ex: drawing cards, $P(A) = \text{ Queen of Spades}, P(B) = \text{ Spades}, P(C) = \text{ Queen}$
		$P(A|B) =$ the probability of drawing a queen of spades, given we know the card is a spade
			$P(A|B) = \frac{1}{13}$
		$P(A|C) =$ probability of drawing a queen of spades, given the card is a queen
			$P(A|C) = \frac{1}{4}$
	Conditional Probability
		distinguishes from dependent and independent events
