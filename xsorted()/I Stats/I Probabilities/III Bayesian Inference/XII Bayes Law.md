Bayes' Rule = Bayes' Theorem = Bays' Law

Events A & B
$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$
Probability of event B occurring, given A has already occurred, is the probability of the intersection of these two events over the probability of B

Bayes Law $= P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) x P(A)}{P(B)}$
		The probability of getting A, given B, is equal to the probability of getting B, given A, times the probability of A over the probability of B
		assess correlations and effects of events upon each other
$BP = \text{Back Pain}$
$VI = \text{Vision Impairment}$
	$P(VI | BP) = 67$%
		 the probability vision impairment, given back pain, is 67%
	$P(BP | VI) = 41$%
		the probability of back pain, given vision impairment, is 41%
So, we see the relationship is not bidirectional, more people with back  have vision impairment, than people with vision impairment have back pain

Business Ex:
what companies are looking for academic quality or relevant experience
$P(E) 45$% had relevant exp
$P(G) 60$% has good grades
$P(G | E) = 50$%
	Probability of getting the job with good grades, given experience
	for the 45% who had relevant experience, 50% already had good grades
$P(E | G) = ?$
$P(E | G) = \frac{P(G | E) \cdot P(E)}{P(G)}$
$P(E | G) = \frac{0.5 \cdot .45}{.6}$
$P(E | G) = 0.375$
	Probability of getting the job with experience, given good grades
	
Companies are more likely to hire someone who has experience than with good grades
