what is a union of two events
if we neither *either* A or B

A union is a combinations of all preferred outcomes for either A or B

US = union, Texas is a set, all citizens are elements of Texas

A $\cup$ B = A is a union of B

if $A \cap B = \emptyset$ , then $A \cup B = A + B$
	no elements in both simultaneously 
	no double counting

A $\cup$ B = A + B - A $\cap$ B
	the sum is the union minus the sum
	A = spades, B = queens; A $\cup$ B = Spades + Queens - Spades overlapping with queens
	A $\cup$ B = Spades + Queens - Queen of Spades

In the office, there are 5 blondes, and four blue eyes, only Kate has both
$BLO \cup BLU = BLU$ [only] + BLO [only] + Kate [both]
$BLO \cup BLU = 4 + 3 + 1$
--- or --- 
$BLO \cup BLU = 5 + 4 - 1$

Event A = from the US
Event B = from Cali
$A \cap B = B$ [all California]
$A \cap B = B + A - B$
