B2 Diversity at Hamilton College
Use Bayes Law to see if student body to determine if the freshmen class is the average for that specific nationality

$A = \text{ First Years}$
$B = \text{ Black}$

$P(A) = \frac{480}{1897}$
$P(A) = 0.253$
25.3% of students are freshmen

Probability of a student being black
$P(B) = \frac{80}{1897}$
$P(B) = 0.042$
4.2 % of students are black

Probability of a freshmen being black
$P(A \cap B) = \frac{26}{1897}$
$P(A \cap B) = 0.014$
1.4% of freshmen are black

Probability of a black student being a freshmen
$P(A|B) = \frac{26}{80}$
$P(A|B) = 0.325$
32.5% chance a black student is a freshmen
	not .25, so increase in diversity in freshmen year

Additive rule:
$A \cup B = 480 + 80 - 26$
$A \cup B = 534$
$P(A \cup B) = \frac{534}{1897}$
$P(A \cup B) = 0.281$
28% of student body is a freshman, or identifies as black

$A = \text{ Freshmen}$
$B = \text{ Black}$
$C = \text{ Hispanic}$
$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$
Probability of being a black, given you are a freshmen, is equal to the probability of being black a black freshmen over the probability of being black
$P(A|B) = \frac{26}{480}$
$P(A|B) = 0.054$
	5.4% chance a freshmen student identifies as black

$P(C|A) = \text{ Probability of being a Hispanic, given they are a freshmen}$
$P(A) = \text{ Probability of being a freshmen}$
$P(A \cap C) = P(A)\cdot P(C|A)$
	$P(C|A) = \frac{57}{480}$
	$P(C|A) = 0.1187$
	$P(A) = .253$
		$P(A \cap C) = .263 \cdot .119$
		$P(A \cap C) = 0.03$
		probability of being a latino freshmen is 3%

Now, probability of a latino being a freshmen
	Bayes' Law: Probability of being a freshmen, given you are a latino, is equal to the probability of being a latino, given you are a freshmen, times the probability of being a freshmen divided by the probability of being a latino
	$P(A|C) = \frac{P(C|A)\cdotP(A)}{P(C)}$
		$P(C) = \frac{167}{1897}$
		$P(C) = 0.088$
		$P(A) = .253$
		$P(C|A) = 0.119$
		$P(A|C) = \frac{0.119 \cdot .253}{0.088}$
		$P(A|C) = .338$
	The probability of a student being in their first year, given they are hispanic, is 33.8%
