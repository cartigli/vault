Describe events and how they interact with eachother

Sets: Upper Case X
element: lower case x

Any set can have values or be empty
emptry set = null set

Non-empty sets can be finite or infinite, depending on elements they poses

we notate an element as part of a Set with $\in$
	$x \in A = x$ is an element of the set A
	or
	$A \in x =$ Set A contains the element a
And the opposite: $\not\subset$
	$x \not\in A$ = element x is not in the set A 
	or
	$A \not\in x =$ Set A does not contain the element x

We notate for all/any with $\forall$
$\forall x \in A =$ for all x in set A

We notate 'as such that' with '$\forall$:'
	useful for making a statement about a specific group of elements within a set
	$\forall x \in A$ :  = for all / any x in A, such that, x is even
		any and all elements x in A; excluding x's with even values

Subset: If every element of set A is also an element of set B, A is a subset of B [not all B elements in A]
Notated with $\subset$
	$A \subset B$

Every set contains at least 2 subsets; itself and the null subset
