sample equivalent of pop, data set

If we recorded all eye colors in the whole world, and 60% were brown, that's a [characteristic] 
If we take a sample of 1,000 people and 60% of them have brown eyes, thats a [statistic]

Confidence Interval [CI]
	operates with degrees of freedom
	Expresses likelihood of the population mean being within that interval
		Approximate the margins for the means of an entire pop. based of sample data
		To calculate, we need: Mean, Variance, and Standard Deviation

In a new country, trying to decide how much cash to bring
	gather ten samples from pop., get mean ($\bar{x}$), and determine an average
	in this ex, $\bar{x}$ = $22.5
		we know prices are normally distributes, so equal on either side
		with 95% confidence, we assume 95% of the prices will fall within one standard deviation of the mean $\bar{x}$ on either side
		so CI = [20; 25]

Hypothesis Testing:
	test previous ex:
		place a value on the graph, and determine the size over the value
		Ex: on the bell curve, with a value like $34, we know this is more than 3 standard deviations from the mean, so probably very unlikely to encounter in the pop. based off the sample
