have to pick 5 numbers between 1 - 69, and Power Ball number between 1 - 26
	Likelihood of 2 individual events occurring is the product of their individual probabilities
	$P(A) \cdot P(B) = P(AB)$

$P(\text{PowerBall Number}) = \frac{1}{26}$
$P(\text{Lottery Number}) = \text{picking 5 elements from 70 possible samples;} n = 69, p = 5$
$C^n_p = \frac{n!}{(n - p)! p!}$
	   $\frac{69!}{(69 - 5)! 5!}$
	   $\frac{69!}{(64)! 5!}$
	   $\frac{65 \cdot 66 \cdot 67 \cdot 68 \cdot 69}{1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5}$
	   $\frac{1348621560}{120}$
  $C^{69}_5 = 11238513 \text{ possible combinations}$
		$P(LN) = \frac{1}{11238513}$

$P(PB) * P(LN) = \frac{1}{11238513} \cdot \frac{1}{26}$
$P(\text{Winning the Lottery}) = 3.42229e^{-9}$

Buying more tickets doesn't change probability of winning because the number of favorable outcomes for success is still 1
