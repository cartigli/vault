Correlation Coefficient= $Cov_{xy} / (Stdev(x) * Stdev(y))$

= 33,491,250 = Covariance of the Sample Above
x: $\sigma^2$: 222
y: $\sigma^2$: 173,615
	Correlation Coefficient: $\frac{33,491,250}{222 \cdot 173,615}$
	Correlation Coefficient: 0.87
		fairly strong correlation coefficient; correlation of 1 would mean 100% of one variable determines the other, 0 would mean no correlation or relationship
			-1 or negative means the opposite; ice cream vs umbrella store, when sunny, ice cream sells and when rainy, umbrellas sell; negative correlation

Correlation of x and y is the same as the correlation of y and x ; the formula is symmetrical
	*does not imply causation*
