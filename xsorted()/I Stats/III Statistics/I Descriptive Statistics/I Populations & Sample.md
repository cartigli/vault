Step one of any statistics is determine if you're working with a Sample or the Population
N = collection of all items of interest [Parameters]
n = subset of the population [Statistics]

			randomness, representatives
		Sample drawn from canteen: not random; was it representatives? also no
		very hard to get true values for both
