Asymmetry: most commonly calculated with 'Skewness'
	almost always calculated with software

Skewness indicates off-centered concentration of frequencies

Mean > Median
	Skewed right, concentrated to the Left
	Positive Skew

Mean = Median = Mode
	No Skew, symmetric

Mean < Median
	Skewed Right, concentrated over the Right
	Negative Skew
