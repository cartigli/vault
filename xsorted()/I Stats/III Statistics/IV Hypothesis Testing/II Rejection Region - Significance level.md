$\alpha$ = Probability of rejecting the null hypothesis, if it is true [false result]
	0.05 most common value
EX;
	$(\text{null}) H_0$: average grade is 70
	$(\text{alt}) H_A$: average grade is not 70
		assume normally distributed
				$Z = \bar{x} - \frac{\mu}{s \cdot \sqrt{n}}$
					pick a z value to represent cutoff regions, or rejection zones for of a normally distributed probability curve
						ex: $\alpha$ = 0.025, so Z = 1.96 {two-sided}
							if one sided, the alpha would be on one tail, and the single z-statistic would be z=1.645
								calculate statistic, $\bar{X}$, standardize {z-scale}, and check it if in cutoff region
