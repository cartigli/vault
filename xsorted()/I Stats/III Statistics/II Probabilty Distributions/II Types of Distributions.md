Picking a card, rolling a dye = discreet distributions
Time & distance = continuous distributions

$X \sim N (\mu, \sigma^2)$
X = variable name
$\sim$ = is approximately
N = Normally distributed
($\mu$, $\sigma^2$) = characteristics of Data Set

[Normal Distribution]
	all events are equally likely; normal distribution
	Cards & tossing coins
	$Y \sim U(a)$

[Bernoulli Distribution] 
	i.e., true or false 
	Only two possible outcomes
	$Y \sim Bern(p)$

[Binomial Distribution]
	continuous Bernoulli, kind of
	Only two outcomes, but many iterations
	$Y \sim B(n, p)$

[Poisson Distribution]
	determines unusualness of an event for a given interval
	$Y \sim Po($A$)$

Continuous Distributions - curve [bell]

[Normal Distributions]
	values are shown around the mean, outliers, or extreme highs/lows, occur less often than mean values
	lower values of pop/mean make these harder to build
	$X \sim N (\mu, \sigma^2)$
	or $Y \sim t(k)$

[Chi-Squared Distribution]
	Asymmetric
	Only consists of non-negative values
	does not mirror real-life events; determines goodness of fit
	$Y \sim X^2(k)$

[Exponential Distribution]
	events that are rapidly changing early on
	viral videos
	$Y \sim Exp(A)$

[Logistic Distribution]
	useful in forecast analysis
	determine cutoff point 
	$Y \sim Logistic (\mu, s)$
