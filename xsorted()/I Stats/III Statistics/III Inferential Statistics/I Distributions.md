[Distribution] is a function that shows the possible values for a variable and how often they occur 
	Ex: dye has same probability of getting 1 ($\frac{1}{6}$) and probability of 3 ($\frac{1}{6}$)
		probability of 0 for getting a 7
		So:
			prob of getting 1-6 = .17
			all other values: 0
				all probabilities summed = 1
	[Discrete Normal Distribution] ^
		all outcomes have an equal chance of occurring
			like a bar chart where every bar is the same value (0.17)
