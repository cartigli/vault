Can't overlap; circles can't intersect

Have the null $\null$ set as their intersection

Their union is the sum of all separate sets

Their complement set is all the values that are a part of the sample space, but not the set 
	Like the surrounding water of a caste; water is the complement, castle is the set, king is an element
	compliments are always exclusive
		not all exclusives are compliments
