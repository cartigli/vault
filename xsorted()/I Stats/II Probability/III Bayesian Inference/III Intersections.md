Intersections of 2 events
When we want A & B to happen at the same time, we want them to intersect
	All favourable outcomes for A and B
	denoted with: '[upside down]U'
	A '[upside down]U' B
		intersection of Events [draw a heart] and Events [draw a spade] is
		a null set, because they never overlap
		$A \cap B = \emptyset$
