Likelihood of an event occurring, given another one has already occurred
$A = \text{Heads}$
$B = \text{Tails}$
	if $P(A) = P(A|B)$, Events A & B are independent

$A = \text{ Queen of Spades}$
$B = \text{ Spades}$
$C = \text{ Queen}$
	$P(A) = \frac{1}{52}$
	$P(A|B) = \frac{1}{13}$
	$P(A|C) = \frac{1}{4}$
		can say event A depends on B & C

$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}
	as long as $P(B) > 0$

$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \text{ is similar to} P(x) = \frac{favorable}{all}$
The new favorable is the intersection of $A \cap B$ so they both must occur to satisfy the conditional;
	$P(B)$ has to happen, so for this case, $P(B) = all$
		$P(A|B) \neq P(B|A)$

What is the probability of event A occurring, given event B has occurred if the likelihood of getting the intersection of their events is 0.15 and P(B) is 0.6?
	$P(A|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.6}$
	$P(A|B) = .25$
