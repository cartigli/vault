$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$
$P(B) * (P(A|B)) = \frac{(P(A \cap B)}{P(B)) x P(B)}$
$P(A|B) * P(B) = P(A \cap B)$

$P(B) = 0.5$
$P(A|B) = 0.8$
Event B occurs 50% of the time, and 80% of when B occurs, A occurs
	Therefore, $P(A \cup B) = 0.8 * 0.5 = 0.4$

Draw two cars, shuffle without returning the card, and draw another 
	What is the probability of drawing a spade on a second draw, and not on the first?
	A = drawing a spade on second try
	B = not drawing a spade on first try
		$P(\text{Spades}) = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25$
		$P(B) = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75$
			$P(A|B) = \frac{13}{51}$
			$P(A|B) = 0.255$
				$P(A) = P(A|B) * P(B)$
				$P(A) = 0.255 \cdot 0.75$
				$P(A) = 0.191$
