visit 5% of restaurants in London; guess mean meal is $22.5
	much better to say 95% of the meals are within $20 & $25
		*can't be 100%*

Confidence level:
	$1 - \alpha$
		if we need 99% confidence, $\alpha$ is 1%
			if we need 95% confidence, $\alpha$ is 5%

Formula:
	(Point Estimate - Reliability Factor * Standard Error, Point Estimate + Reliability Factor * Standard Error)	
	$$(\bar{X} - Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}} \cdot \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}, \bar{X} + Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}} \cdot \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}})$$
