Hypothesis testing
	formulate a hypothesis, find the right test for your hypothesis, test, make decision
	hypothesis = idea that can be tested
could test previous presidency's performance, but couldn't test if Clinton or Trump would be better in the next presidency.

Original Hypothesis = $H_o$
Alternate Hypothesis = $H_1 \text{ or } H_A$
Ex:
	the mean data scientist makes $113,000 = $H_O$
	the mean data scientist does not make $113,000 = $H_A$

"Data scientists make more than $125,000 a year."
	$H_0 : \mu_0 \geq 125,000$
	$H_A : \mu_0  < 125,000$
		Outcomes refers to a population parameter rather than a statistic
		$H_0$ is the status quo; we want innovation
				to reject the null is to innovate
