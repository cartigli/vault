Every value in Python is a logical object; strings, Booleans, integers, floats

Classes:
	objects belong to classes based off attributes they posses/were given from operations
	'Mike' can make bicycles, so he is in the bike-maker class
ex:
object {{ instance }} = [14.9, 14.8, 10.3]
	list class
	attributes: float data
	methods available: .extend(), .index()

Function vs Method
	a function can be applied more broadly
		a method has an object as one of its parameters
	exists on its own
		belongs to a class
	function()
		object.method()
				method depends on the object; can't exist without it
