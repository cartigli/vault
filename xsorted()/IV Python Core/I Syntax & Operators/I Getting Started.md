Source Code: a human readable language that can be translated through software to run a program on a computer
	Python and R are most popular for data and finance

1. series of steps well defined
	1. program that adds 10 takes the input 'x' and outputs 10 + x
2. mechanist thinking
	1. computers can only do what you tell them to do
3. Good style of coding
	1. structured definitions of functions and organized executions

Python has technical advantages and practical applications compared to many programming languages
	open sourced 
	general purpose
		multi-platform and constantly in development
			interoperable with C, Java, R, etc.,
	high level
		technically, machines can only run low-level languages it can interpret
		high level is closer to human language, and easier to read & implement; more intuitive than low-level

Big Data is more complex than Microsoft or Excel can handle; Python is more flexible and can deal with the variety Big Data brings
	Also very powerful

Not automatically updated or maintained 
Jupyter allows code editing throuhg the browser
	comes with a Python kernal for python code interpretation
	well suited for demonstrating the power of python/code
		anaconda has both python and jupyter by defualt?
