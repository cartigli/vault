Clustering:
- red = Asia
- crossed = America
- black = Europe
	- Clustering tells you to treat each cluster independently

A/B Testing
- experimentation, hypothesis testing, multivariate testing
	- experienmentation ex:
	- 2 UIs shown to two groups [same_size/demo]
	- whichever has more engagements is selected
		- if more than 2; multivariate testing

Time Series Analysis
- measurements plotted over x = T.time
	- Sales Forecasting
