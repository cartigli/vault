linear regression - the approximation of a causal relationship between two or more variables'

process 
	get sample data
	design a model that works for that sample
	make predictions for the whole population

Dependent /predicted/ = Y
Independent = $x_1, x_2,...$
	Y = F($x_1, x_2,...$)

[ Simple Linear Regression Model ]
$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \epsilon$
	$\beta_1$ is the quantifies the effect that x has on y
		$\beta_0$ is a constant
		if $\beta_1$ is 0, there's no correlation between the two
				$\epsilon$ is the error, or misfit
Simple Linear Regression Equation
$\hat{y} = b_0 + b_1 x_1$
	$\hat{y}$ is the predicted or estimated value

On the linear regression graph, the line is the estimation of best fit with the slope: $\beta_1$ 

Correlation does not show/suggest causality
	p(x, y) = p(x, y)
	represented with a point

Regression shows how one variable affects another
	one way connection
	represented with a line
