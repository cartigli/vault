[Margin of Error] = $\bar{X} \pm Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}} \cdot \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$
	^^when the population variance, $\sigma$, is known
	If the population variance is unknown, it is determined with:
		[MoE] = $\bar{X} \pm t_{n-1,\frac{\alpha}{2}} \cdot \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$

The True Population Mean falls within the Sample Mean, $\bar{X}$, plus or minus the [Margin of Error]
	smaller [Margin of Error] = smaller confidence interval
		its components
				[Z] or [t] statistic with $\alpha$ in the numerator; decreasing these will decrease the MoE {50% confidence has a smaller MoE than 99% confidence}
				[Standard Deviation] is also in the numerator; decreasing Std Dev decreases the margin of error {less variance = easier to predict}
					[Sample Size] $n$ is on the denominator, so increasing $N$ or $n$ decreases the margin of error {more data = more accurate analysis}
