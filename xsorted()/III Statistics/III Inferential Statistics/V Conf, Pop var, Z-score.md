		[Reliability Factor] = $Z_{\alpha/2}$
			for confidence of 95%, $\alpha$ = .05

	$(\bar{X} - Z_{\alpha/2} * \sigma / \sqrt{n}, \bar{X} + Z_{\alpha/2} * \sigma / \sqrt{n})$
		the [Sample Mean] ($\bar{X}$) will fall between the $\bar{X}$ minus the Z-score of $\alpha/2$ times the [Standard Error] $\sigma / n^2$, and $\bar{X}$ plus the Z-score of $\alpha/2$ times the [Standard Error] $\sigma / n^2$

[Z-Score] : $Z_{\alpha/2}$
	On the Z-Score Table; $\alpha (0.05) / 2 = 0.025$, so
		$1 - 0.025 = 0.975$ on the Z-Chart
			$Z_{0.025}$ = Intersection of row 1.9 and column 0.06
				$Z_{0.025} = 1.96$ ; 1.96 is the [Critical Value] for this [Confidence Interval]

$(\bar{X} - Z_{\alpha/2} * \sigma / \sqrt{n}, \bar{X} + Z_{\alpha/2} * \sigma / \sqrt{n})$ {with values from top of page}

(94,833 105568)
	We are 95% that the average salary is within the range of $94833 and $105568
		A 99% confidence is a z-score of 2.58; as z increases, the confidence does as well
