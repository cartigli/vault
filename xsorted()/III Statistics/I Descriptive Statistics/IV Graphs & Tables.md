Intuitive interpretation of data

Categorical & Numerical
Categorical Data in Graphs:
	Frequency Distribution Tables:
		two columns; categories and frequency of events
	Bar Chart:
		vertical access is frequency, horizontal is categories for measurement
		easy to see relationship
	Pie Chart:
		out of 100%, show value share for each category, relational information
	Pareto Diagram:
		Bar Chart with decreasing frequency of categories
		80% of the effect comes from 20% of the causes
			shows how subtotals change with every additional category
	Cross Tables/Contingency Tables
		You manage 3 investors, and each one varies in risk
			bar chart - each investor has 3 stocks, represented side by side
				easier representation between investors and markets

Numerical Data in Graphs:
	Frequency Distribution Table
		instead of connecting [20 random numbers] by labeling each one as 1;
		we could group into intervals of 5 and count frequencies of each interval, and measure that
			((largest number) - (smallest number)) / (number of desired intervals)
		relative frequency = frequency / total frequency
	Scatter Plot
		represents two fields of numerical data
			SAT scores of 100 individuals
				range from 200-800 points; scatter plot bound by these dimensions
			Interpretations should be taken from distributions over the chart, like up or down trends, and *not* individual events, or outliers
			Find trends, averages, and groupings, not specific points/scores
