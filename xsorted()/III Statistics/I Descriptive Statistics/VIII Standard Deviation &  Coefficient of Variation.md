Population and Sample Standard Deviation Formulas
$$
Pop.: \sim \sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2} ;Sample: \sim S = \sqrt{S^2}
$$
Coefficient of Variation:
	standard deviation / mean; relative Standard Deviation

Population formula:
	$C_v = \sigma / \mu$
Sample formula:
	$\hat{c}_v = s / \bar{x}$

Standard deviation is single most common
	*comparing two standard deviations is basically useless*
		comparing two coefficient variants is explanatory


|          | $     | Pesos   |
| -------- | ----- | ------- |
| mean     | 5.5   | 103.46  |
| sample v | 10.72 | 3793.69 |
| sd       | 3.27  | 61.59   |
| sCV      |       |         |
	$\hat{c}_v = s / \bar{x}$                         $\hat{c}_v = s / \bar{x}$ 
	$\hat{c}_v = 3.27 / 5.5$                 $\hat{c}_v = 61.59 / 103.46$ 
	$\hat{c}_v = 0.595$                       $\hat{c}_v = 0.595$ 
		their mean, variance, and S.D. are significantly different but their relative coefficient variants are not!
