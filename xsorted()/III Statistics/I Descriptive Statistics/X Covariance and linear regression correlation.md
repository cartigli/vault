Relationship between two variables
	Ex: House price and size relationship

Population Covariance Formula:
	$\sigma_{xy} = \frac{\sum^{N} _{i=1} (x_i - \mu_x) * (y_i - \mu_y)}{N}$

Sample Covariance Formula:
	$S_{xy} = \frac{\sum^{n} _{i=1} (x_i - \bar{x}) * (y_i - \bar{y})}{(n - 1)}$
				compare all values of x & y to the mean, sum, and divide by sample size n, - 1

|      | Size | Price     |
| ---- | ---- | --------- |
|      | 650  | 772,000   |
|      | 785  | 998,000   |
|      | 1200 | 1,200,000 |
|      | 720  | 800,000   |
|      | 975  | 895,000   |
| mean | 866  | 933,000   |
we see an upward trend in a scatter plot of this data, suggesting correlation between the two variables of size and price
	the main statistic used to measure this correlation is covariance
		may be positive, negative, or 0
     	= (650-866)*(772,000-933,000) + (785-866)*(998,000-933,000)...
		$= \frac{133,969,000}{5 - 1}$
		$= \frac{133,969,000 }{4}$
		= 33,491,250 = Covariance of the Sample Above
