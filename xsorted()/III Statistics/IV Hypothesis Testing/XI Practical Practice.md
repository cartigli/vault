Determine if significance between mail and female pay
Pooled Variance First
$s^2_p =  ((n_x - 1)s^2_x + (n_y - 1)s^2_y) / n_x + n_y -2$
Pooled Variances, divided by their respective n, is equal to the pooled std dev squared
	pooled variance: 1,146,888,418.06
		f_pop: 98
		m_pop: 76
				$\sqrt{1,146,888,418.06/98 + 1,146,888,418.06/76}$
				$\sqrt{11702943 + 15090637}$
				$\sqrt{26793580}$
				$5176.25$
				Z= 6563.61 - 0 / (5176.25/n)
				Z= 6563.61 - 0 / (5176.25/174)
				Z= 6563.61 / (29.75)
				Z=220??
