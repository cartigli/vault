two departments get grades: Engineering and Mangement
	On average, management outpreforms engineering by 4%

Null Hypothesis is the Engineering department minus the Management department results in -4%
$H_0 : \mu_E - \mu_M = -4$%
$H_A : \mu_E - \mu_M \neq -4$%

	$Z = \bar{X} - \mu / \sqrt{\sigma^2/n_e + \sigma^2/n_m}$
	$Z = -7.00 - -4.00 / 1.23$
	$Z = -3.00 / 1.23$

		p-value = 0.0147
		For $\alpha$ = 0.1, reject the Null Hypothesis
		For $\alpha$ = 0.05, reject the Null Hypothesis
		For $\alpha$ = 0.025, reject the Null Hypothesis
		For $\alpha$ = 0.01, Accept the Null Hypothesis
				Can reject the null hypothesis with up to 97.5% confidence; at 99% confidence, the Null cannot be rejected
				At and up to this point, the negative T-score dictates the hypothesized mean falls below the population mean, suggesting that it is below the hypothesized value
