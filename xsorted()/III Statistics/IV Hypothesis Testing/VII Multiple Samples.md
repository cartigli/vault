magnesium level's in patients taking our drug: dependent samples, and we want to determine the effectiveness; $\mu_B$ is before, $\mu_A$ is after
					{we want increased magnesium!}
$H_O : \mu_b \geq \mu_A$
	the null hypothesis is that the population mean is greater than or equal to the population mean after
$H_A : \mu_B < \mu_A$
	The alternative hypothesis is that the population mean is less than the population mean after
Again:
	$H_O : \mu_b \geq \mu_A$
		$H_O : \mu_b - \mu_A \geq 0$
				$H_O : D_0 \geq 0$
	$H_A : \mu_B < \mu_A$
		$H_A : \mu_B - \mu_A< 0$
				$H_A : D_0 < 0$
$D_0$ = Hypothesized Mean Difference

								Researchers should look for more accurate test & probably find larger samples
