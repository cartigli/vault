playing darts = each distinct outcome has some associated probability
Looking for interval more than value

Pulling cards 20x
	prob of drawing 3 spades or fewer
	P(drawing one spade) + P(drawing two spades) + P(drawing 3 spades) = P(drawing 3 spades or less)
	P(Y $>=$ y) = P [ Y < (y + 1)]
		P(getting 3 spades or fewer) = P(getting four spades or fewer)
