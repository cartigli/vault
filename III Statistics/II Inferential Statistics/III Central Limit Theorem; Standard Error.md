owned car lot, need mean car price, standard variation, and variance
Mean ($\bar{x}$) = $2,617.23
	what if take another sample, and get $3,201.34, and another with $2,844.33?
	What if take many, many samples, and analyse them?
		This is a [Sampling Distribution] of the Mean ($\bar{x}$)
			mean of the sample means will theoretically point us to the population mean
				$\bar{X}_s = Mean-of-the-Sample-Means$
				Gives us a normal distribution, of the Sample Means
					*This is the [Central Limit Theorum]*

[Sampling Distribution] :
	$\sim N (\mu, \sigma^2 / n)$
		The Sampling Distribution with a mean equal to the original mean, and variance equal to the original variance divided by the sample size

[Standard Error] of the Sampling Distribution = $\sigma^2 / n$
	or  $\sigma / \sqrt{n}$
		*[Standard Error] decreases as n increases; higher sample size means reduced Standard Error*

Estimates & Estimators - a type of statistic
Confidence Intervals and Point Estimates
	$\bar{X}$ is a Point Estimate of $\mu$
	$S^2$ is a Point Estimate of $\sigma^2$
		All have two properties; efficiency and bias
				$\bar{X}$ + 2 = $\mu$; 2 is the bias
				efficiency relates to variance
