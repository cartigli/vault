have to pick 5 numbers between 1 - 69, and Power Ball number between 1 - 26
	Likelihood of 2 individual events occuring is the product of their individual probabilities
	P(A) * P(B) = P(AB)

P(PowerBall Number) = 1/26
P(Lottery Number) = picking 5 elements from 70 possible samples; n = 69, p = 5
C(n, p) = n! / (n - p)! p!	
	69! / (69 - 5)! 5!
	69! / (64)! 5!
	65 x 66 x 67 x 68 x 69 / 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5
	1348621560 / 120
	C(69, 5) = 11238513 [possible combinations]
		P(LN) = 1 / 11238513

P(PB) * P(LN) = [ 1 / 11238513 ] x [ 1 / 26 ]
P(Winning the Lottery) = 3.42229e^-9

Buying more tickets doesn't change probability of winning because the number of favorable outcomes for success is still 1
