variation can double count combinations
hiring manager looking to hire 3 people, A, B, & C, of 10
- choosing A, B, & C is the same as choosing C, B, & A
- *different variations, but not different combinations

Permutations - P(n) elements = n!
- P(who to hire) = 6 (1 x 2 x 3)
- 6 variations for Any combination
		6 times fewer combinations than variations, or 6 times more variations than combinations

Variations V{bar}(10n, 3p) = 10! / (10 - 3)! = 8 x 9 x 10 = 720 variations

Combinations C(10n, 3p) = 720 / 6 = 120 [no double counting]

We can say all the different permutations of a single combination are different variations
Permutations = 6, Combinations = 120, Variations = 720

How many combinations can be made form P-many elements out of a sample of N elements?
Number of combinations = Number of variations / Number of permutations
C(n, p) = $\bar{V}$(n, p) / P(n, p) = 
C(n, p) = n! / p! (n-p)!
	C(10, 3) = 10! / 3! (10 - 3)!
	C(10, 3) = 10! / 3! (7)!
	C(10, 3) = 8 x 9 x 10 / 1 x 2 x 3
	C(10, 3) = 720 / 6 = 120

What if 4 clients were picked, not 3?
C(10, 4) = 10! / 4! (10 - 4)! 
C(10, 4) = 10! / 4! (6)!
C(10, 4) = 7 x 8 x 9 x 10 / 4!
C(10, 4) = 7 x 8 x 9 x 10 / 1 x 2 x 3 x 4
C(10, 4) = 5040 / 24
C(10, 4) = 210

how many combos of 3 macs can you get w 8 flavors
n = 8, p = 3
C(8, 3) = 8! / 3! (8-3)!
C(8, 3) = 8! / 3! (5)!
C(8, 3) = 6 x 7 x 8 / 3!
C(8, 3) = 6 x 7 x 8 / 1 x 2 x 3
C(8, 3) = 336 / 6
C(8, 3) = 56 possible combinations [without repeating]

n = 8, p = 5
C(8, 3) = 8! / 5! (8-5)!
C(8, 3) = 8! / 5! (3)!
C(8, 3) = 4 x 5 x 6 x 7 x 8 / 5!
C(8, 3) = 4 x 5 x 6 x 7 x 8 / 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5
C(8, 3) = 6720 / 120
C(8, 3) = 56 possible combinations

n = 8, p = 8
C(8, 8) = 8! / 8! (8-8)!
C(8, 8) = 8! / 8!
C(8, 8) = 1
