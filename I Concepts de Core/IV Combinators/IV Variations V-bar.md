Lock with two dials, each one has a, b, & c options
- choose a for 1st
	- 3 options left
	- 3 options for 1st
- 3 more = 3 x 3 options = 9 variations

$\bar{V}$ = n^p
- n = total elements available
- p = number of positions to fill
	- $\bar{V}$ 3/2, n = 3, p = 2
	- $\bar{V}$ = 3^2
	- $\bar{V}$ = 9 combinations
	What if lock could use any letters?
	- n = ~~3~~ 26
	- $\bar{V}$ = 26^2
	- $\bar{V}$ = 676 combinations
