Sets [events] A, B

[No Overlap] 
	events cannot happen simultaneously 
		Event A = Hearts; Event B = Spades
			Impossible to happen in the same event; no overlap

[Intersecting]
	two events can occur at the same time
	card is drawn
		Event A = drawing a Spade
		Event B = drawing a Queen
			intersection occurs when Queen of Spades is drawn
		Rest of A = non queen spade
		rest of B = non spade queens

[Combine]
	overlap, contain completely
	Set A $\subset$ B ; or set A contains set B
		Event A = drawing a red card
		Event B = drawing a Heart
			All events in B are also in A
			Not all events in A are in B
			If event A occurs, *event B cannot occur*

So:
	If an outcome is *NOT* a part of a SET, it *CANNOT* be a part of any of its *SUBSETS*
	An outcome *NOT* being a part of *SOME* subset, does *NOT EXCLUDE* it from the entirety of the greater set
