1. Supervised Learning
- training similar to teacher supervising students
- labeled data - correct outputs
	- can easily determine the accuracy of the model's output
	- accuracy = expected - actual
	- improve through optimization algorithm

2. Unsupervised Learning
- bag of arrows with no associated targets
- unlabeled data for training
	- hard to calculate accuracy if no output is better than any other

3. Reinforcement Learning
- reward system
- better shots = reward
- bash shots = punish
	- through this repeated process, the model Learns to improve

Other Supervised Learning Techniques [ML]
- Supper Vector Machines
- Neural Networks
- Deep Learning
- Random Forests
- Bayesian Networks

Alt. Unsupervised Learning Techniques [ML]
- K-means [most common]
- Deep Learning [both bc new, complex and abstract scope]

Goal with All Types: Maximize Objective Function
