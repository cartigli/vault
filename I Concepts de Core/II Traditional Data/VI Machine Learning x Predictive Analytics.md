when is ML advantageous to traditional analysis?

Machine Learning Definition: creating an algorithm, which a computer then uses to find a model that fits the data as best as possible, then makes predictions based on that model
- how does this differ from trad. methods?
	- not given directions
	- only rewarded/punished based off prediction when training

Data = arrows [training_data]
Bow & Robot shooting = model [N.N., M.L. Model]
Target = target [y_hat]
Objective Function = calculates single attempt's distance from target
- single attempt's distance from target = [cost]
Optimization Algorithm = mechanic to adjust model's variables
- model's variables = pull strength, degree of shot, aiming direction
- model's variable = [weights]

Training
- never tell target: adjust your stance or improve your aim
- only encourage or discourage based on cost [gradient]
