running a race, need starting order
cannot repeat racers, 5 team members, 4 possible starters, 3 to decide for the rest...
5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120 possible arrangements
Number of variations without repetition when arranging P elements out of a total N
V{bar}n/p = n! / (n - p)!
- P = 4 possible positions 
- n = 5 runners
- V{bar} = 5! / 1! = 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 / 1 x 1 = 120 / 1 = 120

Formula for selecting p elements from n many is:
- C(n, p) = n! / (n - p)! p!

7! / (7-4)! = 4 x 5 x 6 x 7 = 

n = sample size of elements, p = positions to fill
Combinations without repetition: 
	C(n, p) = n! / (n - p)! p!
Combinations with repetition:
	C(n, p) = (n + p - 1)! / (n - 1)! p!
