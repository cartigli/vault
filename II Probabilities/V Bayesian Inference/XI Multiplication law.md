P(A|B) = P(A $\cap$ B) [intersection] / P(B)
P(B) x (P(A|B)) = (P(A $\cap$ B) [intersection] / P(B)) x P(B)
P(A|B) x P(B) = P(A $\cap$ B) [intersection] 

P(B) = 0.5
P(A|B) = 0.8
	Event B occurs 50% of the time, and 80% of when B occurs, A occurs
	Therefore, P(A $\cup$ B) = 0.8 x 0.5 = 0.4

Draw two cars, shuffle without returnring the card, and draw another 
	What is the probability of drawing a spade on a second draw, and not on the first?
	A = drawing a spade on second try
	B = not drawing a spade on first try
		P(Spades) = 1/4 = 0.25
		P(B) = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75
			P(A|B) = 13 [given event B occurred] / 51
			P(A|B) = 0.255
				P(A) = P(A|B) x P(B)
				P(A) = 0.255 x 0.75
				P(A) = 0.191
