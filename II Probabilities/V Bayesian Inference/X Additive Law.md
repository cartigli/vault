P(A $\cup$ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A $\cap$ B)
	Probability of the union of sets A & B is equal to the individual probabilities of A & B summed minus the probability of their intersection

A = being a women
B = being vegan
P(A $\cup$ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A $\cap$ B)
P(A $\cup$ B) = 47/100 + 44/100 - 15/100
P(A $\cup$ B) = .76
	Picking a random from this group, they have a 76% chance of being female, vegan, or both

P(TAB) = 38%
P(SQL) = 45%
	P(TAB $\cup$ SQL) = 66%
	P(TAB $\cap$ SQL) = ? 
Substitute values on the og equations:
	P(A $\cup$ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A $\cap$ B)
	P(A $\cap$ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A $\cup$ B)
	P(A $\cap$ B) = 0.38 + 0.45 - 0.66
	P(A $\cap$ B) = 0.38 + 0.45 - 0.66
	P(A $\cap$ B) = 0.17, or 17% chance someone can do both
