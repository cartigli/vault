the likelihood of an event occurring

express probabilities at relative likelihood
expressed 0-1
probability of 1: certain
probability of 0: certain it won't occur

generally, probability of Event A occurring: P(a)
P(A) = preferred outcomes/all outcomes [sample space]

head/tails; A = Heads
- P(A) = 1/2 = 0.5

6 Sided Dye; preferred outcome: 1
- possible: 6
- P(A) = 1/6 = ~0.167
Same Dye: roll a # divisible by 3
- 2 preferred outcomes, 6 possible outcomes
- P(A) = 2/6 = 1/3 = ~0.333

P(A + B) = P(A) * P(B)
- Deck of Cards: P(Ace[spades]) = P(Ace) * P([spades])
- P(Ace[spades]) = P(4/52) * P(13/52)
- P(Ace[spades]) = P(.0769) * P(.25)
- P(Ace[spades]) = P(0.02)

Lottery: prefered outcome: # of tickets bought
- total possible: 175 million
- P(A) = 1 / 175,000,000 = 0.000 000 005
