Expected outcome when running experiment many times

Coin Toss: don't know outcome, create expirmement
toss the coin = one trial 

creates experimental probabilities
on previous page, we did theoretical (true) probabilities

going to grocery store, find a line 80% of the time
theoretically impossible to calculate this probability (too many variables)
experiments make it easy, or at least to proximate

$P(A) = \frac{Successful Trials }{All Trials}$

E(A) = Expected Outcome
Checking Spaces Probability
categorical outcomes: $E(A) = P(A) * n$
	- n=theoretical probability
	- pulling spades to determine probability
	- P(Spades) = .25
	- Pull 5 spades during experiment; $E(A) = \frac{5 * .25}{52 [all cards]}$

Numerical Outcomes
- Get all individual probabilities and add together

Bow & Arrow
- $(Outer Ring) = 10$
	- $P(OR) = 0.5$
- $(Inner Ring) = 20$
	- $P(IR) = 0.4$
- $(Center Ring) = 100$
	- $P(CR) = 0.1$
Probabilities are:
- $E(X) = P(OR) + P(IR) + P(CR)$
- $E(X) = 0.5(10) + 0.4(20) + 0.1(100)$
- $E(X) = 5 + 8 + 10$
- $E(X) = 23$
- but impossible to get 23 points in a single shot, so how is this expected?
	- per shot, your expected to average 23, ish
