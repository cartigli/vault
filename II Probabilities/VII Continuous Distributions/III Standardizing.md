transformation: a way to alter every element of a distribution to get a new distribution
	for normal, we can add, subtract, multiplication, and division without changing the type of distribution
	y = f(x) -> y = f(x + 3)
		graph moves three to the right
	y = f(x) -> y = f(x - 3)
		graph moves three to the left
	y = f(x) -> y = f(x . c)
		graph width shrinks, tightens
	y = f(x) -> y = f(x / c)
		graph expands, gets wider
			BUT if c is between 0 and 1, the opposite effect will be seen
			diving by 1/2 = multiplying by 2

Standardizing = making the E(X) [expected value] = to 0, and Var(X) = to 1
	called a Standard Normal Distribution
		Z-scores are derived from most common values among this standardized distribution's table of values
	How is a Normal Distribution Standardized?
		first, subtract the $\mu$ from the function; y = f(x - $\mu$)
			now $\mu$ = 0; centered
		then, divide all values by $\sigma$: y = f((x - $\mu$) / ($\sigma$))
			this 'tightens' the bell curve to be Var(X) = 1

Z ~ N (0, 1), Y ~ N($\mu$, $\sigma^2$) = > z = (Y - $\mu$) / ($\sigma$)
	reads as for any normally distributed variable Y, z is normally distributed over Y - $\mu$ / $\sigma$
