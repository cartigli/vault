$N (\mu, \sigma^2)$
$X \sim N (\mu, \sigma^2)$
	variable x follows a normal distribution between $\mu$ & $\sigma^2$
	Graph follows a bell curve; the majority is centered around the mean
	It is also balanced on the left and right, in either direction

E(X) = $\mu$
Var(X) = $\sigma^2$
	Var(X) = $E(X^2) - E(X)^2$

68, 95, 99.7 Law
	for any normally distributed event, 68% of all outcomes fall within 1 standard deviation of the mean; 95% of the outcomes fall within two, and 99.7 fall within three
