$t (k)$ [k = degrees of freedom]
$Y \sim t (k)$
	variable Y follows a student's t distribution with 3 degrees of freedom
	sample size approximation of smaller sample size than a bell curve
	also bell-shaped and symmetric
		has fatter tails due to increased of variables at extreme ends

if $k > 2, E(Y) = \mu$
$Var(Y)$ = $(S^2.k) / (k - 2)$
	$S$ = variance of sample
