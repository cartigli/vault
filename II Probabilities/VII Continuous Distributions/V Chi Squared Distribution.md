$\chi^2 (k)$ [k=degrees of freedom]
$Y \sim \chi^2 (3)$
	variable Y follows a chi-squared distribution with 3 degrees of freedom

Confidence intervals, Hypothesis testing, goodness of fit

Graph; skewed to the left, start at 0 [never below]
Student t Distribution = $Y \sim t (k)$
Student t Distribution$^2$ = $Y^2 ~~ \chi^2 (k)$ [chi-squared]
$\sqrt{chi-squared}$ = $\sqrt{\chi} \sim t (k)$ = Student's t Distribution

Contains known values, like the Student's t Distribution
	$E(X) = k$
	$Var(X) = 2k$
