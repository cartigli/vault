an option is agreement between two parties for the price of a stock or an item at a future point in time
allows one side to decide whether to go through with the deal alter
gives on an advantage, and the other is paid a premium
	how much are you willing to pay for the pact?

Ex: 10 stocks, $1100 each, one week
	40% probability of increase to 1200
	60% probability of decrease to 1000
		$100 premium
Current price: 10 stocks cost $11,000 right now
	If falls (0.6), 10 x $1,000 = $10,000, or $1,000 less
		don't take the option; loose the premium you paid
	If rises (0.4), 10 x $1,200 = $12,000, or $1,000 more
		take advantage of the option, pay the premium and make profit

Price = $1,100; you pay $100 premium to have the option to buy 10 stocks at current price in one week.
Next week, there are two possibilities
	A. Price increases from $1,100 to $1,200
		You take the option, pay the $100 premium, and profit 10 x $100 [rise] - $100 [premium] = $900 profit
	B. Price decreases from $1,100 to $1,000
		You don't take the option, pay $100 premium, and are saved $1,100 - $100 = $1000 loss

$E(P) < 0$ = disadvantageous, taking it increases risk without increasing reward
$E(P) = 0$ = Fair Deal, rejecting or accepting changes nothing about risk
$E(P) > 0$ = Favorable; profit is expected
	$E(P) = .6(loss) x (-100(loss cost)) + .4(up) x (900(profit))$
	$E(P) = -60 + 360$
	$E(P) = +300$
	Favourable, BUY!!
		most of the time, they are trying to balance this deal
		a premium increase of 300 would make this a fair deal
			therefor, accept the deal of any premium up to $400

With no premium on the deal:
Price = $1,100; buying 10 of the same stock
	Option A: Buy 10 @ $1,100, pay $11,000
		in one week, the stock price rises from $1,100 to $1,200
		the value of the stock you hold increases by $1,000
	Option B: Buy 10 @ 1,100, pay $11,000
		in one week, the stock price sinks to $1,000
		the value of the stock you hold decreases by $1000
Stock Raise; A = 0.4
Stock Down; B = 0.6
E(Payout) = B = $0; no premium, don't buy
	A = $1,000 - $0 premium
	$E(P) = .6(loss) x (0) + .4(up) x (1000(profit))$
	$E(P) = 0 + 400$
	$E(P) = +400$
	also equal to premium, so max price we'll pay

A: 1,125
B: 1,000
$E(P) = .6(loss) x (0) + .4(up) x (250(profit))$
$E(P) = 0 + 100$
$E(P) = +100$ = maximum premium we'd pay

A: 1,200 (0.2)
B: 1,000 (0.8)
$E(P) = .8(loss) x (0) + .2(up) x (1,000(profit))$
$E(P) = 0 + 200$
$E(P) = +200$ = maximum premium we'd pay
