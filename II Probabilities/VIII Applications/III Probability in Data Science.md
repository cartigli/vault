General --> Concrete Analysis
Probability -> Statistics -> Data Science

Regressions => Supervised Machine Learning

Data Analysis study historical data to make predictions about future events
Machine Modeling: runs simulations to see how well our predictions align to various possible future outcomes

Monte Carlo Situation
	if we predict a 40% chance on some event, the model should show that event happening 40% of the time

ML: rapid pace query and adjustment on training data
	all its predictions have confidence intervals as well

Data Science: an expansion of probability, statistics, and programming that implements computational technology to solve more advanced questions
	data science is fundamentally based on probability; it cannot exist without it
