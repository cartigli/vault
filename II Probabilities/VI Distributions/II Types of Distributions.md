Picking a card, rolling a dye = discreet distributions
Time & distance = continuous distributions

X ~ N ($\mu$, $\sigma^2$)
X = variable name
~ = tilde
N = type of distribution
($\mu$, $\sigma^2$) = characteristics of Data Set

[Normal Distribution]
	all events are equally likely; normal distribution
	Cards & tossing coins
	Y ~ U(a)

[Bernoulli Distribution] 
	i.e., true or false 
	Only two possible outcomes
	Y ~ Bern(p)

[Binomial Distribution]
	continuous Bernoulli, kind of
	Only two outcomes, but many iterations
	Y ~ B(n, p)

[Poisson Distribution]
	determines unusualness of an event for a given interval
	Y ~ Po($A$)

Continuous Distributions - curve [bell]

[Normal Distributions]
	values are shown around the mean, outliers, or extreme highs/lows, occur less often than mean values
	lower values of pop/mean make these harder to build
	X ~ N ($\mu$, $\sigma^2$)
	or Y ~ t(k)

[Chi-Squared Distribution]
	Asymmetric
	Only consists of non-negative values
	does not mirror real-life events; determines goodness of fit
	Y ~ $X^2$(k)

[Exponential Distribution]
	events that are rapidly changing early on
	viral videos
	Y ~ Exp($A$)

[Logistic Distribution]
	useful in forecast analysis
	determine cutoff point 
	Y ~ Logistic ($\mu$, $s$)
