Y = outcome of an event
y = one of the possible outcome 
	P(Y = y) or P(y)

Y = red marbles drawn from a bag
y = 5 marbles drawn
	P(Y = 5) or P(5)

P(y) = probability function
	record the frequency of each unique value & divide it by the total number of elements [has to be finite]
	smaller measurement between elements = more accuracy

distributions defined by two things only:
	mean = $\mu$
		average value
	variance = $\sigma^2$
		how 'spread' the data is
		more spread out, more variance

Population or Sample Data?
	population = whole data
	sample data = subsection collected
		new notation for mean and variance
			Sample Mean: $\bar{X}$
			Sample Variance: $s^2$
				measured squared, so measuring in seconds would have variance as sec^2
		Population
			standard deviation [sqrt of variance] : $\sigma$
				$\mu$ + $\sigma$ and $\mu$ - $\sigma$ are one standard deviation above and below the mean
				$\sigma^2$ = Expected((Y - $\mu$)$^2$ )
				$\sigma^2$ = Expected(Y)$^2$ - ($\mu$)$^2$
